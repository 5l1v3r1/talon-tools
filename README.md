# Talon-Tools: The Framework for Practical IEEE 802.11ad Research
The Talon-Tools project consolidates our set of software tools for practical reasearch with commodity IEEE 802.11ad devices. It bases on TP-Link's Talon AD7200, which is the first wireless router that supports the IEEE 802.11ad standard and was released in 2016. Using this platform allows to investigate various aspects of 60 GHz millimeter-wave communication in realistic on-site experiments.

## Content
We will realease our tools shortly.

## WARNING
This software might damage your hardware and may void your hardwareâ€™s warranty. Use our tools at your risk and responsibility.
