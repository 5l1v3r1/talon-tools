# Talon Tools: The Framework for Practical IEEE 802.11ad Research
The Talon Tools project consolidates a set of software tools for practical research with commodity IEEE 802.11ad devices. It bases on TP-Link's Talon AD7200, which is the first wireless router that supports the IEEE 802.11ad standard and was released in 2016. Using this platform allows to investigate various aspects of 60 GHz millimeter-wave communication in realistic on-site experiments. With our framework, we support various kinds of experiments and evaluations performed with multiple routers in arbitrary environments.
